A Guide to Synthwave

5 Jun

Written By Dan Schwebel

Synthwave, also known as retrowave or outrun, is an electronic music genre that grew in the mid-2000s, yet was strongly inspired by the sonic and aesthetic elements of the 1980s. With a retrofuturistic spirit, synthwave recreates the nostalgic ambiance of the 80's pop culture, video games, and sci-fi films, presenting it for the modern audience. Utilizing synthesized melodies, pulsating rhythms, and atmospheric effects, synthwave creates lush, neon-lit musical landscapes that evoke a sense of nostalgia. This genre's rise in popularity signals a widespread longing for the retro aesthetics of the past, made accessible through modern music technology. What is Synthwave? At its core, synthwave music is created using synthesizers and drum machines, producing a sound that resonates with 80s pop and electronic music. The synthwave sound palette typically includes sweeping synth pads, vibrant lead synths, pulsating, or pluck-y basslines, and electronic drum machine beats, all wrapped in an atmosphere thick with reverb and delay effects. Synthwave music is often instrumental, although vocals - either sampled, synthesized, or organic - can sometimes be included. When vocals are present, they often echo the stylistic trends of 80s pop music, featuring catchy, melodic hooks and completely, and utterly drowned in reverb (in a good way). It's important to note that synthwave is not only a music genre but a broader cultural aesthetic. It includes visual art characterized by neon colors, grid patterns, and retrofuturistic themes inspired by the 1980s' sci-fi and action films. This aesthetic extends to album art, music videos, and live shows, providing a complete immersive experience in the 80s nostalgia. There are also several subgenres within synthwave, each adding its unique twist to the central 80s-inspired theme. For example, darksynth (or darkwave) takes a heavier, more aggressive approach, drawing more from 80s horror films and cyberpunk aesthetics, often used in soundtracks for action, horror, or sci-fi videogames. On the other hand, dreamwave is a more relaxed, dreamy subgenre, focusing on creating atmospheric, ambient soundscapes. What sets synthwave apart from many other genres is its deep-rooted sense of nostalgia, combined with an admiration for the future - a concept often referred to as retrofuturism. This duality allows listeners to travel back in time while still rooted in the present, creating a uniquely timeless appeal. While synthwave has seen significant growth in recent years, particularly in online music communities, it remains a predominantly underground genre, with most artists releasing music independently. Despite this, the influence of synthwave can be felt in mainstream pop and electronic music, with many modern tracks incorporating the iconic 80s synthesizer sounds and drum machine rhythms. Ahem, Weekndâ€¦ In summary, synthwave is a vibrant, nostalgic genre of music that combines the iconic sound design of the 1980s with modern production techniques. Its charm lies in its ability to transport listeners to a different time, invoking a sense of nostalgia while maintaining a fresh, contemporary feel. Its influence continues to grow, impacting various aspects of pop culture, from music and fashion to film and graphic design. Prominent Synthwave Artists There many talented artists capture the genre's essence, each bringing their unique touch to the retro-futuristic aesthetic. I tried to complile a list of some of my favourite artists, as well as some of the most influential to offer a fantastic entry point into the genre and serve as a testament to the diversity within synthwave: 1. Sellorekt/LA Dreams: Known for his prolific output, Sellorekt/LA Dreams is a staple in my listening habits. His music captures the heart of '80s pop culture, creating a nostalgic soundscape filled with pulsating basslines and emotive synths.

2. Timecop1983: Hailing from the Netherlands, Timecop1983 is an artist who specializes in dreamy, cinematic synthwave, with funky elements. His tracks often feature lush synth pads, emotional melodies, and occasionally, hauntingly beautiful vocals. His music evokes the feeling of a late-night drive through a neon-lit cityscape.

3. The Midnight: This duo has made significant waves in the synthwave scene with their unique blend of saxophone solos, heartfelt lyrics, and dreamlike synths. They expertly encapsulate the sentiment of nostalgia, creating songs that transport listeners back in time.

4. Kavinsky: Perhaps one of the most recognizable artists in the genre, Kavinsky shot to prominence with his track "Nightcall," featured in the film Drive. His music combines synthwave with elements of French house, characterized by his heavy, resonating synths, and an atmosphere drenched in mystery and intrigue.

5. FM-84: Another renowned duo in the synthwave scene, FM-84, create music that encapsulates the essence of a sun-drenched, '80s California dreamscape. Their iconic track "Running in the Night" is a true testament to their ability to craft catchy melodies and unforgettable lyrics, along with the use of copious amounts of reverb.

6. Com Truise: Com Truise's music is a fusion of synthwave with chillwave, IDM, and nu-disco elements. Perhaps one of the most influential in the scene, his sound design is unique and instantly recognizable, often characterized by off-beat, syncopated rhythms, lush, spacey synths, and heavy, compressed drums.

7. Perturbator: Known for his darker take on synthwave, Perturbator's music leans towards the darksynth subgenre, featuring heavier beats, darker tones, and a significant influence from '80s horror and sci-fi soundtracks.

8. Carpenter Brut: His music, much like Perturbator's, falls under the darksynth umbrella. Carpenter Brut's tracks often feature fast-paced, aggressive rhythms combined with soaring lead synths, reminiscent of '80s action movie soundtracks.

9. Gunship: Gunship's music stands out due to their creative blend of synthwave with elements of synth-pop and rock. Their tracks are known for their emotive lyrics, atmospheric soundscapes, and iconic music videos.

10. Miami Nights 1984: As the name suggests, Miami Nights 1984 captures the essence of a neon-lit, '80s Miami nightlife. His tracks are filled with pulsating rhythms, bright, soaring synths, and an overall atmosphere of euphoria and nostalgia.

These artists are a testament to synthwave's broad spectrum and its capacity to incorporate various influences and subgenres while remaining faithful to its '80s inspired roots. Synthwave vs Vaporwave Vs Chillwave I think where we struggle is the overlap between genres that sit at the periphery of synthwave. Synthwave, Vaporwave & Chillwaveare all genres that share certain elements, particularly their roots in nostalgia and the use of synthesizers, but they each have distinct characteristics that set them apart.

Musical Structure of Synthwave Synthwave's heart pulsates at a tempo typically between 70 and 120 beats per minute (BPM). This BPM range embodies the genre's energetic drive at the higher end and its capacity for more introspective, or romantic compositions at the lower end. The tempo doesn't just affect the pace but significantly influences the mood and the overall emotional narrative of the track. Considering the arpeggiated basslines, the BPM, to my mind, is more relevant than it seems to be in other genres (excluding those that are often played by DJs, which requires beat matching). From a musical theory perspective, synthwave is defined by its reliance on certain types of chord progressions. Many tracks utilize major and minor extended chords, helping to establish a rich, atmospheric sound with a nostalgic flavor. These chord progressions, reminiscent of '80s pop and cinematic scores, often employ a mix of diatonic and non-diatonic progressions to keep the listener engaged and the music dynamic. I would also argue there is a lot of suspended chords as well. Try it. Instant 80s. Regarding rhythm, synthwave tends to lean into straightforward 4/4 time signatures, mirroring its roots in pop and rock music. The drum patterns usually follow standard pop and dance music conventions, with emphasis on the 2nd and 4th beats in a measure, often known as the backbeats. These elements combine to create a driving rhythm that propels the music forward. In terms of sound design, synthwave relies heavily on the use of vintage synthesizers or modern equivalents to reproduce those tones. These include polyphonic synthesizers for lush chord voicings, monophonic synths for melodic leads and basslines, and drum machines for rhythmic elements. The synths typically feature sweeping pads, bright, detuned leads, and deep, arpeggiated basses. For the drum machines, sounds reminiscent of the LinnDrum is commonly used, imbuing the music with a distinct '80s timbre. I wouldnâ€™t anticipate a tonne of groove or swing, with it remaining fairly straight, 4-on-the-floor. Sound processing plays a crucial role in synthwave's sonic palette as well. Techniques like heavy reverb and delay are commonly employed to add depth and space to the mix, often giving the music an ethereal quality. Chorus and flanger effects are used to thicken synths and introduce movement in the sound, while bitcrushers and tape saturation plugins are used to introduce a lo-fi, vintage texture, although more common in chillwave. In summary, the interplay of BPM, musical theory, rhythm, and sound design defines the sonic identity of synthwave. These elements, rooted in the musical aesthetics of the 1980s yet shaped by modern production techniques, work in harmony to create the genre's unique retro-futuristic soundscape. Essential Equipment for Synthwave Tools are important. And in synthwave, the tools more-or-less dictate the sound. While these can all be replicated efficiently with software, these hardware synths I believe gave birth to the sonic palette of synthwave: Synthesizers

By incorporating these synthesizers, drum machines, effects, and VST plugins into their productions, synthwave producers can craft the nostalgic, retro-futuristic soundscapes that define the genre. Synthwave Production Techniques

By utilizing specific approaches to drums, bass, effects, and sequencing, producers can create the distinctive sounds that define synthwave. Here are key production techniques commonly used in synthwave: 1. Drums and Rhythm: The driving rhythm of synthwave relies heavily on drum machines. Classic drum sounds from machines like the Roland TR-808, LinnDrum, and Oberheim DMX are often used to achieve the punchy kicks, snappy snares, and crisp hi-hats synonymous with the genre. I would keep this simple, Kick on the 1 & 3, and snare on 2 & 4. Hi-hat on the 8th notes. 2. Pulsing Basslines: Synthwave is characterized by its powerful basslines that provide a solid foundation for the music. Create a plucky bass, with a snappy envelope. Either program a bassline that hits on every 8th note, or use an arpeggiator. These basslines often feature driving, repetitive patterns with a focus on rhythmic consistency, creating an infectious groove that propels the track forward. 3. Chords: Sequence a chord progression consistent with the bassline. Try to take a pop influeced chord progression and extend some of the chords into 7ths or 9ths. Also throw a sus2 or sus4 chord by dropping the 3rd. 4. Reverb: Gated reverb is a signature effect used extensively in synthwave. This effect combines a large reverb tail that is abruptly cut off, creating a distinct percussive and rhythmic sound. Synthwave producers apply gated reverb to drums, synth stabs, and other elements, resulting in a pulsating and dynamic quality reminiscent of '80s production techniques. For the rest, a standard digital hall reverb should suffice, just make sure your signal is swimming in it. By incorporating these production techniques, synthwave producers can achieve the desired sound and atmosphere. The careful selection of drum sounds, the creation of pulsing basslines, the use of gated reverb for rhythmic impact, and the precise sequencing of melodies and arpeggios are all essential elements that contribute to the distinctiveness of the genre. Whether working with hardware or software, these techniques enable producers to transport listeners to a retro-futuristic world filled with pulsating rhythms, nostalgic melodies, and infectious energy. Synthwave Aesthetic The synthwave genre not only captivates listeners with its distinctive sound but also immerses them in a visually evocative aesthetic. The synthwave aesthetic draws inspiration from the futuristic imagery of the 1980s, featuring neon-soaked cityscapes, retro-futuristic technology, and the visual style of '80s films and video games. It encompasses both the visual and auditory elements, creating a cohesive and immersive experience for its audience. The visual aesthetic of synthwave embraces vibrant neon colors, bold geometric shapes, and futuristic elements. It often showcases imagery of retro-inspired cityscapes, palm trees silhouetted against glowing sunsets, and iconic '80s symbols like VHS tapes, cassette decks, vinyl records and retro arcade machines. These visuals transport listeners into a world that blends nostalgia with a futuristic, cyberpunk-like atmosphere.
